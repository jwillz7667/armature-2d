# @marionette/conformance

The cross-runtime behavioral-truth check for Armature 2D. It holds the committed reference rigs,
the per-rig sample specs, and the expected-output fixtures generated from `runtime-core` (the
TypeScript behavioral source of truth). Every runtime (web today; Unity and Godot when they land in
Phase 5) must reproduce these fixtures within one shared tolerance. The authoritative design is
`docs/plan/cross-cutting/conformance-and-ci.md`.

## The four fixture tracks

All under `src/`:

| Track | Rigs / inputs | Fixtures | Lock |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Skeleton** | `rigs/` (24 rigs, each committed as `.json` AND a binary `.bin` twin): rig-2bone, rig-rigid-mesh, rig-weighted-mesh, rig-one-bone-ik, rig-two-bone-ik, rig-transform-constraint, rig-deform, rig-transform-modes, rig-blendmodes, rig-events-draworder, rig-events-loop, rig-ik-depth, rig-constraint-order, rig-transform-variants, rig-linked-mesh, rig-sequences, rig-split-tracks, rig-skin-scoped, rig-clipping, rig-hit-point, rig-path-follow, rig-path-spacing, rig-physics-pendulum, rig-physics-swing | `fixtures/` (24, driven by `sample-spec/`) | `.fixtures.lock` |
| **Effects / particles** | `effects-rigs/` (4): coin-burst, ribbon-trail, circle-spawn, god-rays-sprite | `effects-fixtures/` (4) | `.effects-fixtures.lock` |
| **AnimationState** (ADR-0005) | `anim-state-rigs/anim-state-rig.json` | `anim-state-fixtures/` (4): discrete-flip, additive-layer, queue-loop-boundary, crossfade-fractions | `.anim-state-fixtures.lock` |
| **Slot** | `slot/scenes/` (4 scenes) x `slot/spins/` (6 spins) via `slot/sample-spec/` | `slot/expected/` (6 golden `PresentationTimeline`s) | `.slot.fixtures.lock` |

Plus two **cross-language golden corpora** under `src/cross-language/`. `seed-prng-crc-vectors.json`
(WP-5.5): golden vectors for `spinSeed` (FNV-1a-32), `hash32`, `instanceSeed`, the Mulberry32 stream,
and CRC-32/ISO-HDLC (including the CRC of each binary rig twin body); the TS, C#, and GDScript runtimes
must reproduce these bit for bit. `clip-geometry-vectors.json` (PP-B2, ADR-0012): the clipped output of
the Sutherland-Hodgman triangle clipper for a fixed set of (polygon, triangle-list) inputs (ring count,
per-ring source triangle and vertex count, positions, and barycentrics); all three runtimes must
reproduce the ring structure EXACTLY and the positions/barycentrics within the `VERTEX` tolerance.

Lock files are sha256 manifests over rig + spec + fixture + binary twin, keyed to the pinned
toolchain (`node-24.20.0-v8`).

The last two skeleton rigs are the PP-B1 coverage pair (conformance A.2): **rig-transform-modes**
exercises all five bone transform modes under a rotated, non-uniformly-scaled, reflected animated
parent, so every `worldFromParentByMode` branch (including the `noScaleOrReflection` reflection-removal
path) is observed in the per-bone world affine; **rig-blendmodes** carries the four slot blend modes on
four slots and animates each slot's color. To make the blend track observable, a fixture sample gained
an optional `slots` member (`{ slot, blendMode, color }` per captured slot): a rig's sample-spec opts in
with a `slots: [names]` list, so bone-only and mesh-only fixtures stay byte-identical. `blendMode` is a
discrete exact-compare lane; `color` rides the `COLOR` tolerance.

The last two skeleton rigs are the PP-B4 pair (Stage F1, ADR-0008): **rig-events-draworder** carries a
draw-order timeline that reorders three slots mid-clip plus event keys with resolved payloads, and
**rig-events-loop** fires events across a looping event-step sweep that crosses the loop boundary twice
(including a key exactly at the loop point). Two fixture lanes make them observable: a per-sample integer
`drawOrder` permutation (`drawOrder[renderPosition] = slotIndex`, EXACT compare), opted in with the
sample-spec's `captureDrawOrder`; and a fixture-level fired-event log (`events`, one record per fire with
name/int/string/time EXACT and float on the `EVENT_FLOAT` tolerance), produced by sweeping the
sample-spec's `eventStep`. Both lanes are emitted only when the spec opts in, so every pre-PP-B4 fixture
regenerates byte-identically. Together with the PP-B1 pair these close all four `a2-coverage` `it.todo`
entries.

The final two skeleton rigs are the PP-B5 pair (Stage F2, ADR-0009 + ADR-0010): **rig-ik-depth** drives
the IK constraint-depth solve (softness easing near full extension, uniform and non-uniform stretch beyond
reach, and compress inside the fold dead zone, on both one- and two-bone chains, plus a keyed softness
channel); **rig-constraint-order** assigns an explicit `order` that schedules a transform constraint before
an IK constraint on a dependent bone, an interleaving that provably differs from the default IK-then-
transform order. Both observe only the existing per-bone world-affine lane (no fixture-schema change), and
they add no lanes to any other rig, so every pre-PP-B5 fixture regenerates byte-identically.

**rig-transform-variants** (PP-B5 slice 2, ADR-0010 section 3) drives the four transform-constraint
variants: one constrained bone per variant (world absolute, local absolute, world relative, local
relative) under a rotated parent so the world and local results provably differ. It too observes only
the bone world-affine lane.

**rig-linked-mesh** (PP-B5 slice 4, ADR-0011 section 1) is a mesh plus two linked meshes that reuse its
geometry: one with `timelines: true` (its vertices track the parent's deform exactly) and one with
`timelines: false` (its own deform diverges). Observed on the existing mesh-vertex lane.

**rig-sequences** (PP-B5 slice 5, ADR-0011 section 2) resolves sequence-attachment frames across all seven
playback modes (hold, once, loop, pingpong, and the three reverses) plus the setup-frame fallback (a slot
with a sequence attachment but no `sequence` timeline). It is observed on a new per-sample `sequences` lane
(`{ slot, frame }` per captured slot, opted in with the sample-spec's `captureSequences`), compared EXACT
because the frame index is discrete integer math. The lane is emitted only when the spec opts in, so every
non-sequence fixture stays byte-identical.

**rig-split-tracks** (PP-B5 slice 6, ADR-0011 section 3) exercises the per-component split bone tracks
(translateX/Y, scaleX/Y, shearX/Y, observed on the bone world-affine lane, and unit-tested to equal the
joint channels), the split rgb/alpha slot color (observed on the existing slot color lane), and the keyable
two-color dark tint (observed on a new optional `dark` field of the slot capture, compared on the COLOR
tolerance). The dark field is emitted only for a slot with a setup `darkColor`, so pre-slice-6 slot captures
stay byte-identical.

**rig-skin-scoped** (PP-B5 slice 7, ADR-0011 section 4) locks skin-scoped constraint solving: a transform
constraint scoped to skin "gold" solves only while "gold" is active, while an unscoped one always solves.
It uses a new per-sample `activeSkins` sample-spec knob (parallel to `poseTimes`) to sample the same rig
under active skin null (scoped off) and "gold" (scoped on), observing the on/off difference on the bone
world-affine lane. Scoped bones are pure data with no transform-solve effect (ADR-0011 section 4).

The last two skeleton rigs are the PP-B2 pair (Stage 0, ADR-0012), locking the clipping / bounding-box /
point solve. **rig-clipping** animates a clip bone (moving the world clip polygon) whose `end` slot is a
deforming mesh, and carries a draw-order key that changes which slots the clip covers; a new per-sample
`clips` lane captures `{ slot, attachment, worldPolygon, clippedSlots }` (the world polygon on the
`VERTEX` tolerance, the clipped-slot name list EXACT). **rig-hit-point** carries a bounding box and a
point on a moving bone; a `boxes` lane captures `{ worldVertices, hits }` (world vertices on `VERTEX`,
per-probe even-odd hits EXACT against the spec's `hitProbes`) and a `points` lane captures
`{ x, y, rotation }` (position on `VERTEX`, rotation on the new `ANGLE` tolerance). The Sutherland-Hodgman
triangle clipper itself is locked cross-language by `clip-geometry-vectors.json` (above). All three lanes
are emitted only when the spec opts in, so every pre-PP-B2 fixture regenerates byte-identically.

The final two skeleton rigs are the PP-B6 pair (Stage F3, ADR-0011 format 0.5.0 + ADR-0013 solve), locking
the path attachment / path constraint solve. **rig-path-follow** drives bones along an OPEN straight
diagonal path with all three rotate modes (tangent, chain, chainScale), percent and fixed position, and an
animated `position` channel; **rig-path-spacing** drives four 3-bone chains along a CLOSED square path, one
per spacing mode (length, fixed, percent, proportional), constant-speed on, with an animated `spacing`
channel. A path constraint writes bone transforms, so both observe only the existing bone-world-affine lane
(no new fixture lane) and every pre-F3 fixture regenerates byte-identically. Because both use straight
Bezier segments (evenly spaced control points, so each curve's arc length is linear in the parameter), an
INDEPENDENT analytic oracle (`test/path-oracle.test.ts`) checks the first generation against closed-form
world transforms, so the fixtures are verified rather than merely frozen.

The last two skeleton rigs are the PP-B7 physics pair (Stage F4, ADR-0014 format 0.6.0 + solve), locking the
physics-constraint solve, the ONE constraint kind that steps over time. **rig-physics-pendulum** is a
rotation-channel damped-driven oscillator: an animated angular impulse the spring overshoots and rings down,
with a physics timeline keying `strength` and fading `mix` in, under nonzero scene gravity/wind that a
rotation-only constraint provably ignores (external forces feed the x and y channels only, ADR section 2.3).
**rig-physics-swing** simulates x/y/scaleX under gravity + wind + mass (a hanging prop that sags under gravity
and sways in the wind), with a keyed wind gust, the global-times-local `mix` product, and a mid-clip
translation TELEPORT that trips the RESET_DISTANCE snap (the bone jumps to the new pose at rest rather than
whipping across the gap). Physics carries velocity across frames, so unlike every other rig these are sampled
SEQUENTIALLY: the harness advances the physics clock by the poseTime delta each frame (0 on the first). The
integrator is a fixed-timestep semi-implicit (symplectic) Euler on an integer step clock (STEP_FIXED_ONE =
65536), mirroring the emitter solve exactly; the step-clock integer primitive is locked cross-language by the
`physicsStepFixed` vectors in `cross-language/seed-prng-crc-vectors.json`. Both observe only the existing
bone-world-affine lane, so every pre-F4 fixture regenerates byte-identically.

## Structure

- `registry.ts`: the `RigId` union, ordered `RIG_IDS`, per-rig phase map, and `CONFORMANCE_PHASE`
  gating.
- `schema/`: Zod schemas and typed validators for rigs, sample specs, and every fixture shape.
- `build-fixture.ts`, `build-effects-fixture.ts`, `build-anim-state-fixture.ts`,
  `build-slot-fixture.ts`: PURE builders, (inputs, spec, provenance) to fixture, importing only
  `runtime-core`, `format`, and (for slot) `math-bridge` types. No clock, no random.
- `generate.ts` plus `generate-effects` / `generate-anim-state` / `generate-slot` scripts: the
  generator CLIs. Each refuses to run on a mismatched Node before writing anything.
- `io.ts`: the only filesystem module (path resolution, validating loaders, sha256).
- `compare/`: `tolerance.ts` (the SINGLE source of the epsilon policy) and the compare engines
  producing structured `DriftReport`s.
- `run-phase3-acceptance.ts`: the Phase 3 Definition-of-Done harness
  (`pnpm phase3:acceptance`, 11 checks).

## Tolerance policy (A.5)

Tight but nonzero (IEEE-754 arithmetic is not associative across V8, .NET, and GDScript). The
formula is `|actual - expected| <= atol + rtol * max(|actual|, |expected|)`:

| Class | atol | rtol |
|---|---|---|
| WORLD_TRANSLATION | 1e-4 | 1e-6 |
| WORLD_BASIS | 1e-6 | 1e-6 |
| VERTEX | 1e-4 | 1e-5 |
| COLOR | 1e-5 | 0 |
| EVENT_FLOAT | 1e-5 | 1e-6 |
| ANGLE | 1e-4 | 1e-6 |
| PARTICLE | 1e-4 | 1e-5 |
| PARTICLE_COLOR | 1e-5 | 0 |

Integer lanes (live counts, spawn order, frame indices, vertex counts) compare EXACT, as do slot
timelines (integer milliseconds and integer base units, plain deep-equal). Loosening a tolerance to
make a runtime pass is forbidden; that is a solve bug by definition.

## Regenerating fixtures (the A.6 ceremony)

Fixtures are generated FROM `runtime-core` and committed. Regeneration is a deliberate, reviewed
act behind the behavior-change gate (the `behavior-change` label, CODEOWNERS on `fixtures/**`, an
ADR or CHANGELOG entry). Never hand-edit a fixture.

```sh
# Use the PINNED Node (fixtures store V8-computed floats as exact JSON; the drift gate is a
# byte-exact git diff, so the generation toolchain must match .node-version exactly).
nvm use "$(cat .node-version)"   # 24.20.0
pnpm --filter @marionette/conformance generate            # skeleton track
pnpm --filter @marionette/conformance generate:effects
pnpm --filter @marionette/conformance generate:anim-state
pnpm --filter @marionette/conformance generate:slot
pnpm --filter @marionette/conformance exec tsx scripts/gen-clip-geometry-vectors.mts  # PP-B2 clipper golden
```

The drift gate regenerates and runs `git diff --exit-code` over the rig/spec/fixture trees: any
solve-behavior change in `runtime-core` without regenerated fixtures fails CI.

## Tests

```sh
pnpm --filter @marionette/conformance test               # all tracks
pnpm phase3:acceptance                                   # the Phase 3 DoD harness (from repo root)
pnpm conformance:particles                               # the effects fixture suite (from repo root)
```

Notable suites: the independent closed-form **oracle** for rig-2bone (`test/oracle.test.ts`, so the
first fixture generation was checked against hand-computed values, not merely frozen), in-memory
round-trip regeneration per track, `phase2-rigs`, `phase3-effects`, `phase3-perf-gates`,
`phase4-slot`, `anim-state`, `binary-twins` (WP-5.1), `cross-language-vectors` (WP-5.5),
`clip-geometry-vectors` (PP-B2, the clipper golden drift tripwire), `geometry-attachments` (PP-B2
clip/box/point observability coverage), and the `a2-coverage` meta-test that gates every solve branch
the current fixture schema observes (the unobserved branches are pending `it.todo` entries by design).

The tolerance-based tests pass on any modern Node; only the byte-exact drift gate and lock files
are toolchain-sensitive and must run on the pin.
