// and the runtime-core-side fixture round-trip) are pure and run in the Node environment. They read
// the committed rig, sample-spec, and fixture from disk, so the filesystem is the only I/O. The Phase 3
// perf gates (phase3-perf-gates.test.ts) add allocation probes that need a real GC, so the worker is
// launched with --expose-gc (the probe asserts the per-frame heap delta stays within the committed
// perf/baseline.json budget).
