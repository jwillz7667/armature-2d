// AnimationState (ADR-0005): the game-facing layer that plays MULTIPLE animations at once on top of the
// pure single-animation sampler. It is plain state plus pure functions (the repo's stateless-by-default
// style): setAnimation / crossfadeTo / queueAnimation / clearTrack mutate the tracks, updateAnimationState
// advances them by an explicit dt (NO wall clock, NO random: Law 1 determinism), and applyAnimationState
// runs the locked six-step solve with a BLENDED step 2 (blend the applied locals, never world matrices).
// It owns no pose: the caller passes the reused solve buffer to applyAnimationState, so the prepared-
// animation cache and every scratch buffer stay pose-owned and allocation-free in steady state.

// The public, mostly-readonly view of a track entry (ADR-0005). The engine-managed fields (trackTime,
// mixTime, mixDuration, mixFrom, loop, animationId) are readonly: updateAnimationState advances them and
// callers only observe them. `alpha` (blend weight, default 1) and `additive` (rule 3 layering vs rule 2
// replace) are the two author-configurable fields, so they are writable: a game sets `entry.additive =
// true` for a layered overlay or `entry.alpha = 0.5` to half-weight a track. It is a live view onto the
