// prevCumulative RULE: `0` for the first step (k === 0), else `cascades[k-1].cumulativeWin`. The chain is
// therefore contiguous and non-overlapping (each link starts where the previous ended), and its terminal
// `toUnits` is `cascades[last].cumulativeWin`, which validation (WP-4.1) requires to equal
// `result.totalWin` exactly. The WP-4.8 single line-win rollup is SUPPRESSED for cascade spins (emitWinSequence
// already gates on `cascades`), so exactly one rollup channel fires (no double-count, section 5.4.3).
//
// DELIBERATE DEVIATION (per-step VFX): the plan's stage-5 sketch lists "the authored vfxBurst", but the
// owned `TumbleChoreography` schema carries NO vfx preset / anchor field, and inventing one is out of scope
// for WP-4.10 (it would be a format change). Rather than emit a `vfxBurst` with a fabricated preset name
// (which would fail the renderer's load-time preset resolution, WP-4.11), the per-step cascade VFX is
// SKIPPED here and is driven elsewhere (the win-sequence / feature-flow VFX already covers the spin, and a
// future TumbleChoreography vfx field is the natural home). This keeps every emitted directive
// engine/author-truthful and changes no committed slot fixture.
//
// The function reads `result.cascades` / `result.initialGrid` VALUE TYPES and the authored `tumble` timings
// only; it decides nothing (LAW 1). The drop solver re-derives the survivor moves AND the next board, so the
// stage chains steps from `initialGrid`; a WP-4.10 test asserts the final chained board equals `result.grid`.
